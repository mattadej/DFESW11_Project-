# DFESW11_Project

The overall objective of this project was to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training.

Specifically, you are required to create a Spring Boot API using:
-   an application back-end developed using the Java programming language
-   a managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider  (e.g.  H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
-   a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

-   A frontend using Thymeleaf to make the API easier to use
-   Spring security to add protection to the frontend application

## Screenshots showing Postman requests and output from API

The server successfully processed the request but does not return anything. We know it was successful because of the "Status: 204 No Content" status in the middle right of the image.
